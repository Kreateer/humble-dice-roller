# Humble Dice Roller

This is a dice roller I made as a fun little project while working on some other stuff.

I used [PySimpleGUI](https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI) to create a minimal GUI for the program.

### NOTE: If you intend to clone and build it yourself, you can use [PyInstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/) to create an .exe file.
